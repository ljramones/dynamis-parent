# Physics ↔ Collision Authority Audit

Date: 2026-03-10
Scope: Focused authority-seam audit only (no refactor)

## Current Authority Map

### Physics (intended simulation authority)

`PhysicsWorld` in `DynamisPhysics` exposes simulation ownership surface:

- stepping and time control (`step`, pause/resume)
- body mutation (`applyImpulse`, `applyForce`, `applyTorque`, `setVelocity`, `teleport`)
- constraint lifecycle
- character/vehicle/ragdoll runtime lifecycle
- simulation queries and event drain

Reference: `DynamisPhysics/dynamisphysics-api/src/main/java/org/dynamisphysics/api/world/PhysicsWorld.java:26-85`

### Collision (currently mixed substrate + simulation authority)

`DynamisCollision` includes clean substrate areas (bounds/shapes/broadphase/narrowphase/contact generation), but currently also owns simulation-style runtime concerns.

## Exact Seam Pressure Points

### 1. Collision world stepping and integration lives in Collision

`CollisionWorld3D.step(...)` performs:

- gravity velocity integration
- position prediction
- constraint iteration
- contact response application

Reference: `DynamisCollision/collision_detection/src/main/java/org/dynamiscollision/world/CollisionWorld3D.java:178-227`

### 2. Contact solver/resolution authority lives in Collision

`ContactSolver3D` performs:

- position correction
- restitution/friction impulse solve
- warm-start handling
- direct velocity/position writes via `RigidBodyAdapter3D`

Reference: `DynamisCollision/collision_detection/src/main/java/org/dynamiscollision/contact/ContactSolver3D.java:30-209`

### 3. Fixed timestep utility is in Collision world package

`PhysicsStep3D` provides deterministic fixed-step accumulation utility under collision world runtime namespace.

Reference: `DynamisCollision/collision_detection/src/main/java/org/dynamiscollision/world/PhysicsStep3D.java:22-83`

### 4. Collision public surface currently exports simulation-oriented packages

`org.dynamiscollision` exports `world`, `contact`, and `constraints` as public module surface.

Reference: `DynamisCollision/collision_detection/src/main/java/module-info.java:11-16`

## Responsibility Classification

### Collision-query substrate (appropriate in Collision)

- shape/bounds primitives
- broadphase and narrowphase detection
- filtering and pair pipeline
- contact manifold generation utilities

Reference example: `ContactGenerator3D` in `DynamisCollision/collision_detection/src/main/java/org/dynamiscollision/contact/ContactGenerator3D.java:27-194`

### Simulation authority (should be Physics-owned)

- simulation stepping/integration loop
- constraint solving loop policy
- contact position/velocity resolution
- warm-start impulse lifecycle as simulation runtime behavior

Current location: `CollisionWorld3D`, `ContactSolver3D`, `PhysicsStep3D`

## Seam Verdict

Verdict: **needs boundary tightening (authority correction)**

Reason:

- Physics API clearly declares simulation authority.
- Collision still executes simulation/resolution logic and exposes it publicly.
- This is not just naming ambiguity; it is executable authority overlap.

## Recommended Next Narrow Slice

Execute a targeted **Physics ↔ Collision authority re-seam slice** (no broad rewrite):

1. Define an explicit seam contract: Collision returns detection/query/manifold results; Physics applies integration/resolution decisions.
2. Mark collision-side simulation constructs (`CollisionWorld3D.step`, `ContactSolver3D`, `PhysicsStep3D`) as transitional in docs/contracts.
3. Introduce Physics-owned adapter consumption path for one constrained contact-resolution flow, leaving compatibility paths intact.
4. Defer package moves/API deletions; keep first implementation slice additive and behavior-preserving.

## Recommendation

Proceed with a narrow implementation slice for seam correction before broader repo-by-repo reviews. This seam is now the highest-signal authority hotspot outside the graphics cluster.

Commits:

- `dfae62e` (`DynamisCollision`): collision-side response-path policy gate
- `cdda2dc` (`DynamisPhysics`): representative Physics-preferred integration-flow coverage

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: policy components existed, but representative integration proof of composed preferred flow was fragmented.
- After: representative Physics-preferred integration flow is covered with configured seam policies and explicit fallback behavior, while collision-side policy gate behavior is validated in Collision tests.
- Fallback: legacy paths remain intact and explicitly test-covered.

Outcome:

- Added representative integration-flow test coverage in Physics (`PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowIntegrationTest`) proving configured seam-policy execution and fallback routing.
- Kept collision-side response-path policy gate validated in Collision tests from P11.
- Documented cross-repo API-version constraint: Physics currently compiles against released `org.dynamiscollision` API, so direct `setResponsePathPolicy(...)` wiring in Physics code remains pending aligned dependency adoption.

### P13 — Dependency-aligned representative direct wiring (completed)

Commits / alignment action:

- `5d79308` (`DynamisPhysics`): representative Physics integration flow now directly configures `CollisionWorld3D.setResponsePathPolicy(...)`.
- Local dependency alignment action: installed updated `collision_detection` artifact (`1.1.1`) from `DynamisCollision` so Physics compiles against the policy-gate API.

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: representative Physics integration test could not directly wire `setResponsePathPolicy(...)` due cross-repo API version mismatch.
- After: representative Physics flow directly wires collision response-path policy gate along with Physics seam policies.
- Fallback: legacy fallback branches remain unchanged and explicit.

Outcome:

- Closed the representative direct-wiring gap identified in P12.
- Preserved bounded scope (test/integration wiring only; no broad behavior rewrite).

### P14 — Production-facing representative entrypoint wiring (completed)

Commit:

- `69fc223` (`DynamisPhysics`): added production-facing representative integration entrypoint `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowConfigurator` and routed representative integration coverage through it

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: representative preferred-path composition was demonstrated in tests, but no dedicated production-facing entrypoint existed for that composed wiring.
- After: `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowConfigurator.configure(...)` provides an opt-in production-facing entrypoint that applies composed preferred-path wiring (`setResponsePathPolicy(...)` + preferred responder assignment) for representative flows.
- Fallback: legacy/default behavior remains unchanged when configurator is not applied; fallback routing remains explicit inside preferred responder policies.

Outcome:

- Added bounded production-facing entrypoint without changing global defaults.
- Updated representative integration tests to exercise the production-facing configurator path.
- Preserved additive/non-breaking scope.

### P15 — Production-facing preferred-flow convenience preset (completed)

Commit:

- `e8ec3d5` (`DynamisPhysics`): added `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowPresets` with one representative default policy bundle around `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowConfigurator`

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: production code could enable the preferred flow via configurator, but had to assemble policy/responder wiring manually.
- After: `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowPresets.configureDefault(...)` provides one bounded production-facing convenience preset for a representative adapter shape with default seam-selection/ordering/persistence behavior.
- Fallback: legacy/default behavior remains unchanged when preset is not used; explicit seam-selection override and fallback responder behavior remain available when preset is used.

Outcome:

- Added one narrow preset entrypoint without changing global defaults.
- Added focused coverage proving default preset preferred-path behavior and explicit seam-selection override to fallback.
- Preserved additive/non-breaking scope.

### P16 — Production-entrypoint preset wiring (completed)

Commit:

- `a96cbbb` (`DynamisPhysics`): wired the production-facing configurator entrypoint to consume the P15 default preset bundle

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: the convenience preset existed, but production callers had to choose between low-level configurator wiring or calling preset helpers directly.
- After: `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowConfigurator.configureDefault(...)` is a production-facing runtime assembly entrypoint that applies the representative default preset wiring for one adapter shape.
- Fallback: legacy/default behavior remains unchanged when configurator is not applied; explicit seam-selection override and fallback responder routing remain available via configurator overloads.

Outcome:

- Added one bounded production assembly surface that now routes through preset-based preferred-flow wiring.
- Updated focused integration coverage to exercise configurator default + override entrypoints.
- Preserved additive/non-breaking scope with no global default flip.

### P17 — Non-test runtime composition adoption (completed)

Commit:

- `c735076` (`DynamisPhysics`): added `PhysicsCollisionWorldAssemblies` as a concrete non-test runtime composition callsite using `PhysicsCollisionPreferredFlowConfigurator.configureDefault(...)`

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: preferred-flow default wiring was exposed via configurator/preset entrypoints, but no concrete non-test runtime composition helper consumed that path.
- After: `PhysicsCollisionWorldAssemblies.createWithPreferredDefaults(...)` constructs `CollisionWorld3D` and applies configurator default wiring in one production-facing composition callsite.
- Fallback: explicit opt-out remains available via seam-selection override overload; legacy/default behavior remains unchanged for non-adopting flows.

Outcome:

- Added one bounded, non-test runtime assembly adoption callsite for the preferred path.
- Added focused integration coverage for assembly default-path behavior and explicit opt-out fallback routing.
- Preserved additive/non-breaking scope with no global default flip.

### P18 — First external consumer adoption foothold (completed)

Commit:

- `2f9d5dc` (`DynamisCollision`): added one concrete external runtime consumer callsite in `demo` adopting `PhysicsCollisionWorldAssemblies.createWithPreferredDefaults(...)`

Before/After/Fallback:

- Before: preferred-flow runtime assembly helper existed only inside `DynamisPhysics`; no external consumer used it in production code.
- After: `org.dynamiscollision.demo.PhysicsPreferredCollisionWorldFactory` provides one concrete cross-repo runtime composition callsite that adopts Physics-preferred default wiring.
- Fallback: explicit seam-selection override remains available; non-adopting callsites remain unchanged.

Outcome:

- Added one bounded external consumer adoption foothold outside `DynamisPhysics` (single repo, single callsite).
- Added focused coverage proving default preferred-path behavior and explicit opt-out fallback behavior in the external consumer module.
- Preserved additive/non-breaking scope with no global default flip.

### P19 — Next candidate (bounded)

Target:

- Adopt the same preferred-flow assembly path in one primary non-demo runtime consumer (outside `DynamisPhysics`), after minimal dependency alignment if required, while preserving explicit opt-out and legacy defaults.

Constraints:

- Additive and compatibility-preserving.
- One consumer integration only; no broad rollout.
- No solver/runtime rewrite and no global default behavior change.
