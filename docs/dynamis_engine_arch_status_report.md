Below is the **consolidated Dynamis Engine Architecture Status Report** synthesizing all subsystem reviews, tightening programs, and the package standardization initiative.

This is meant to be the **architectural snapshot of the engine right now**, not a speculative design document.

# Dynamis Engine Architecture Status Report

Date: 2026-03-16
Scope: System-wide subsystem boundary ratification synthesis + package standardization

---

# 1. Executive Summary

The Dynamis engine architecture is structurally strong. Most subsystems have **clear authority boundaries**, and the recent tightening programs (notably Physics/Collision and graphics-cluster seams) have significantly improved architectural coherence.

The **package standardization initiative** is now **COMPLETE** — all subsystem Java packages have been unified under the `org.dynamisengine.*` root. This eliminates inconsistent naming conventions that accumulated during early development and establishes a single, predictable namespace for the entire engine.

Additionally, a **large-file refactoring program** has split oversized source files across MeshForge, DynamisGPU, DynamisPhysics, and DynamisLightEngine (Phases 1 and 2), improving maintainability without changing runtime behavior.

The architecture currently falls into three categories:

### Clean / Boundary Ratified

Subsystem boundaries are consistent with the engine authority model.

### Ratified with Minor Tightening Recommended

Subsystem architecture is correct but implementation surfaces should be narrowed or guarded.

### Requires Architectural Correction

Subsystems currently assume authority that belongs to other systems.

At present:

```
Clean:                ~70% of subsystems
Minor tightening:     ~30%
Architectural fix:    0% (AI and Scripting verified correct in 2026-03-15 audit)
Package standardization: 100% COMPLETE
```

The two subsystems previously flagged for correction (DynamisAI, DynamisScripting) have been **verified architecturally sound** — the causality chain is correctly implemented and no canonical mutation authority leakage exists. Remaining work is concentrated in code quality (large file decomposition, test coverage, JPMS adoption).

---

# 2. Engine Authority Model (Canonical)

The Dynamis architecture follows these core rules.

### Execution Authorities

```
DynamisWorldEngine
    → world lifecycle / runtime orchestration

DynamisLightEngine
    → render planning

DynamisGPU
    → GPU execution

DynamisPhysics
    → simulation authority
```

### Substrate Systems

```
DynamisCollision
    → detection / query substrate

DynamisECS
    → entity/component state

DynamisSceneGraph
    → spatial representation
```

### Domain Systems

```
DynamisAI
    → decision / planning / intent

Animis
    → animation evaluation

DynamisAudio
    → audio runtime

DynamisScripting
    → script execution / rule evaluation
```

### Utility / Library Systems

```
DynamisExpression
fastnoiselitenouveau
Vectrix
MeshForge
```

These must **never accumulate runtime authority**.

---

# 3. Package Standardization Initiative

## Target Convention

All subsystems must use `org.dynamisengine.*` as the base Java package. Maven groupIds follow the same convention.

```
Target:    org.dynamisengine.<subsystem>
Example:   org.dynamisengine.collision, org.dynamisengine.physics, org.dynamisengine.animis
```

Exceptions:
* **Vectrix** — targets Java 8 bytecode, already migrated to `org.dynamisengine.vectrix`
* **fastnoiselitenouveau** — targets Java 17, third-party fork, exempt
* **DynamisExpression** — MVEL3 fork, retains `org.mvel3` package

## Migration Status

---

# 5. Subsystem Classification

## Clean / Boundary Ratified

These subsystems align well with the architecture model.

### Infrastructure

* **DynamisCore**
* **dynamis-parent**
* **DynamisEvent**
* **DynamisECS**
* **DynamisSceneGraph**
* **DynamisWindow**
* **DynamisInput**
* **DynamisLocalization**

These form the runtime substrate and do not exhibit authority leakage.

---

### Rendering Architecture

* **DynamisLightEngine**
* **DynamisGPU**

Graphics cluster tightening eliminated earlier boundary issues:

* VFX GPU descriptor leakage removed
* feature systems limited to data generation
* LightEngine owns render planning

DynamisGPU Vulkan internals refactored: VulkanMemoryOps split into focused BufferOps/ImageOps helpers, upload executor validation extracted, bindless heap creation separated from runtime descriptor updates.

---

### Feature Systems

* **DynamisSky**
* **DynamisTerrain**
* **DynamisVFX**

These now correctly produce render data and maintain feature-local state without GPU authority.

---

### Simulation Layer

* **DynamisPhysics**
* **DynamisCollision**

The Physics/Collision migration program successfully established:

```
Collision → detection / query
Physics   → simulation authority
```

Legacy solver paths remain only as fallback. Package naming standardized to `org.dynamisengine.collision` and `org.dynamisengine.physics`. Pre-existing ambiguous method reference bug in CollisionWorld3D factory methods fixed during migration.

---

### Content / Session

* **DynamisContent**
* **DynamisSession**

Clear responsibility boundaries:

```
Content → runtime content identity / manifests
Session → persistence / save-load
```

No orchestration leakage detected.

---

### Geometry / Animation Layer

* **Animis**
* **MeshForge**
* **Vectrix**

Package naming standardized across all three. MeshForge underwent significant refactoring: MeshPacker (1730 lines) split into 6 focused classes, MgiStaticMeshCodec split into writer/reader, GltfMeshLoader accessors and buffer ops extracted. JMH benchmarks confirmed all splits are performance-neutral.

---

# 6. Ratified With Minor Tightening Recommended

These systems are architecturally correct but contain boundary pressure points.

---

## Animis (Animation)

Ownership is correct:

```
pose evaluation
blending
playback
IK / warping
root motion extraction
animation events
```

Pressure points:

* animation-local physics stepping
* direct execution of event listeners

Recommended tightening:

```
keep animation events advisory
keep physics interaction query-based
```

---

## DynamisExpression

Correct architectural role:

```
expression parsing
transpilation
evaluation
```

Risk exists through embedding:

```
imports
static imports
dynamic execution
```

Recommendation:

```
restrict evaluation contexts
constrain callable surfaces
separate public API from compiler internals
```

**Thread safety fixes (2026-03-16) — DONE:**

The three classes previously flagged as not thread-safe have been addressed:

```
ClassManager:     volatile lookupSupplier field, unmodifiable getClasses() return,
                  define() race confirmed safe
LambdaRegistry:   4 HashMap → ConcurrentHashMap, 2 int → AtomicInteger,
                  volatile RegistryEntry.path field
MVEL.get():       thread safety achieved by fixing ClassManager and LambdaRegistry above
                  (MVEL class itself had no direct thread safety issues)
```

Note: DynamisExpression retains `org.mvel3` package as it is a fork of the MVEL3 project.

---

## fastnoiselitenouveau

Correctly behaves as:

```
deterministic procedural utility
```

Minor issues:

* broad API surface
* mutable instance configuration

These are hygiene issues rather than authority problems. Exempt from package rename (Java 17 target, third-party MIT fork).

---

## DynamisAudio

Correct domain ownership:

```
playback
mixing
voice lifecycle
spatial audio evaluation
```

Minor boundary pressure exists in:

```
dynamis-audio-simulation
```

which temporarily hosts collision-world assembly examples from the Physics/Collision migration program.

This is acceptable transitional integration residue.

Long-term preference:

```
move cross-subsystem bootstrap examples to reference application
```

---

# 7. Subsystem Authority Verification (2026-03-15 Audit)

The following subsystems were flagged for architectural correction in earlier reviews. A fresh code audit has clarified their actual status.

## DynamisAI — Verified Correct (with minor execution path cleanup)

DynamisAI's purpose is to give NPCs and monsters **agency** — the ability to reason about the world, weigh options, and make decisions that create emergent, dynamic behavior. This is distinct from DynamisScripting, which defines the **rules** that govern the world.

```
DynamisScripting → defines the ruleset (quest conditions, baseline behaviors, win/loss states)
DynamisAI        → gives entities agency within (and manipulation of) those rules
```

An NPC should be able to decide to betray the player, a monster should be able to weigh odds and retreat, a corrupt guard should be able to selectively enforce laws. This decision-making, planning, and rule-manipulation is AI's core authority and should not be restricted.

**Legitimate AI authority:**

```
decision-making      choosing actions based on situation and personality
planning             multi-step goal pursuit, strategy
intent emission      declaring what an entity wants to do
rule manipulation    exploiting, bending, or selectively applying the ruleset
perception           evaluating world state to inform decisions
```

**Audit finding:** The earlier concern about `commitTick` authority leakage has been **clarified**. `worldStore.commitTick()` advances DynamisAI's own internal agent state snapshot — it does **not** mutate canonical world state. All world changes flow correctly through the Intent → Oracle pipeline. No direct canonical mutation was found.

```
Verified:  AI decides → emits intent → Oracle validates → CanonLog records
Verified:  commitTick() is internal agent snapshot, not canonical mutation
Verified:  No direct Physics dependency; movement is internal to Navigation module
```

**Remaining cleanup:** Some movement integration paths could benefit from clearer intent emission boundaries, but no architectural violation exists.

---

## DynamisScripting — Verified Correct

DynamisScripting legitimately owns **game rule definition and evaluation**:

```
quest logic          ("if quest 23 incomplete by day 31, fail it")
event-driven triggers ("on button click, open door")
narrative sequencing  ("if holy artifact not obtained by month 4, demon king wins")
condition evaluation  against world state
Canon / Percept      reading world state to make rule decisions
```

**Audit finding:** The causality chain is correctly implemented:

```
RuntimeTick orchestration:
    1. Advance CanonTime
    2. Chronicler.tick() → evaluates story nodes → emits WorldEvents via WorldEventEmitter
    3. Oracle.commitWorldEvent() → commits Chronicler proposals to CanonLog

Key verification:
    ✓ DefaultChronicler (27 lines) never commits directly — proposes via WorldEventEmitter only
    ✓ DefaultWorldOracle (196 lines) is sole canonical mutation authority
    ✓ CanonTimekeeper never uses wall-time for simulation progression
    ✓ Oracle.commitWorldEvent() intentionally bypasses Validate/Shape phases for Chronicler proposals (pre-trusted)
    ✓ No agent cognition mutation — Oracle never sets beliefs, forces emotions, or overrides AI state
```

The correct relationship is in place:

```
WorldEngine
    → advances simulation time, calls into Scripting each tick

DynamisScripting
    → evaluates rules against current world state
    → emits events/intents ("QuestFailed", "GatesOfHellOpened")
    → does NOT independently advance simulation time
    → does NOT directly mutate entity positions / physics state
    → does NOT orchestrate subsystem initialization order
```

**Status:** No architectural correction required. Causality chain is sound.

**Deferred items (not architectural issues):**

```
GraphLoader.loadFromYaml()         → throws exception; uses buildManually() (content pipeline task)
SocietyProfileLoader.loadFromYaml() → similar deferral
ContractCostTable hot-reload        → partial; uses deterministic defaults
DslValidator AST analysis           → currently uses keyword scanning (enhancement, not violation)
```

---

# 8. Cross-Subsystem Integration Status

Recent tightening programs have established good patterns.

### Preferred Path + Fallback Pattern

Used successfully in:

```
Physics / Collision
```

with:

```
preferred architecture path
legacy fallback retained
runtime toggle
```

This pattern should guide future corrections.

### Dependency GroupId Standardization

All Maven groupId references across the ecosystem have been updated to match the `org.dynamisengine.*` convention. Eliminated stale groupIds include: `org.meshforge`, `org.dynamiscollision`, `org.dynamisphysics`, `org.animis`, `org.dynamisecs`, `org.dynamisscenegraph`, `org.dynamiscontent`, `org.dynamissession`, `org.dynamisassetpipeline`, `org.dynamislight`, `org.dynamisvfx`, `org.dynamissky`, `org.dynamisterrain`, `io.dynamis`, `org.dynamisinput`, `org.dynamislocalization`, `org.dynamisui`, `org.dynamisworldengine`, `org.dynamisai`, `org.dynamisscripting`, `org.dynamis.event`, `org.dynamis` (for core and window). All consumer POMs have been updated.

---

# 9. Architectural Risk Areas

### Code Quality — Large Files

Several files exceed recommended size thresholds and would benefit from decomposition:

**Completed:**

```
DynamisLightEngine  OpenGlContext.java           3,553 → 1,618 lines (2026-03-15)
    Extracted: GlShaderSources (868), OpenGlShadowRenderer (643), OpenGlPostProcessor (450),
               OpenGlTextureLoader (244), OpenGlTemporalAA (226), GlMathUtil (152)
```

**Phase 2 — DynamisLightEngine (2026-03-16):**

```
DynamisLightEngine  OpenGlEngineRuntime.java       2,370 → 1,120 lines (53% reduction)
    Extracted: 4 capability-specific coordinator classes
DynamisLightEngine  VulkanMainPipelineBuilder.java 1,467 → 453 lines (69% reduction)
    Extracted: 3 pass-specific builder classes
```

**Monitoring (no further decomposition planned):**

```
DynamisLightEngine  VulkanContext.java             1,840 lines  → acceptable (well-decomposed into subpackages)
```

**Monitoring:**

```
Vectrix             Matrix4f.java               15,867 lines  → inherent to zero-allocation design, not splittable
Vectrix             MemUtil.java                  7,919 lines  → preprocessor backends, required for Java 8 target
DynamisExpression   Mvel3ToJavaParserVisitor.java  3,333 lines  → complex transpilation, acceptable for alpha
```

---

### Test Coverage Gaps

**Expanded (2026-03-15):**

```
DynamisVFX          9 → 123 tests   (parity harness, budget, physics, scheduling, core logic)
DynamisSky         15 → 128 tests   (solar position, sky models, color conversions, LUT cache, scheduler)
DynamisTerrain     19 → 168 tests   (frustum culling, matrix math, heightmap ops, road mesh, material atlas)
```

**Expanded (2026-03-16):**

```
DynamisAudio        → 462 tests     (85 new: GainNode, CompressorNode, EqNode, FingerprintDrivenReverbNode,
                                      EmitterParams, ReverbWetGainCalculator, FingerprintBlender, LinearResampler)
DynamisUI           → 98 tests      (32 new: FlowLayout, StackLayout, Label, PerformanceOverlay,
                                      event routing edge cases, Bounds extensions)
DynamisWorldEngine  → 45 tests      (36 new: DefaultWorldTickRunner, DefaultWorldProjector,
                                      DefaultWorldBootstrapper, CodecRoundtrip)
```

**Remaining gaps:**

```
OpenGlEngineRuntime   decomposed (2,370 → 1,120 lines) — now testable
```

---

### JPMS Adoption (**COMPLETE — Engine-Wide** — 2026-03-16)

All engine subsystems now have `module-info.java` files. JPMS migration is complete across all seven layers:

```
Layer 1: DynamisCore, DynamisEvent, Vectrix                          — already modular
Layer 2: DynamisGPU, MeshForge, Animis, DynamisCollision             — complete
Layer 3: DynamisECS, DynamisSceneGraph, DynamisSession,
         DynamisContent, DynamisAssetPipeline                        — complete
Layer 4: DynamisLightEngine (8 modules), DynamisSky, DynamisTerrain,
         DynamisVFX, DynamisAudio                                    — complete
Layer 5: DynamisScripting, DynamisAI, DynamisPhysics,
         DynamisExpression (mvel-main, mvel-benchmarks)              — complete
Layer 6: DynamisUI (including demos), DynamisInput, DynamisWindow,
         DynamisLocalization                                         — complete
Layer 7: DynamisWorldEngine                                          — complete
```

DynamisLightEngine was migrated first (8 module descriptors), followed by Layers 2-3 (DynamisGPU, MeshForge, ECS, SceneGraph, Session), and finally Layers 4-7. ServiceLoader backend discovery formalized with `provides`/`uses` declarations. All previously automatic modules now have explicit module descriptors.

Note: DynamisExpression mvel-main has 156 pre-existing test failures unrelated to JPMS (alpha-stage transpiler).

---

### Integration Patterns

* ~~**Reflection-based feature bridges** in DynamisLightEngine~~ — **DONE** (2026-03-16). All three bridges migrated:
  - `ExternalUpscalerBridge`: migrated to ServiceLoader with config fallback
  - `VendorUpscalerSdkProvider`: migrated to ServiceLoader with config fallback
  - `VulkanSkyRuntimeBridge`: replaced all reflection with typed `SkyRenderBridge` SPI + ServiceLoader; DynamisSky provides `SkyRenderBridgeProvider`
* DynamisAudio collision assembly examples should move to reference application.

---

### Incomplete Implementations

```
DynamisAudio        PanamaAudioDevice           Phase 0 — native calls stubbed (WASAPI/CoreAudio/ALSA)
DynamisAudio        dynamis-audio-music          declared in POM but module not yet created
DynamisAudio        dynamis-audio-procedural     declared in POM but module not yet created
DynamisTerrain      physics/meshforge modules    requires uncommented with correct module names — DONE
DynamisExpression   thread safety                DONE — ClassManager, LambdaRegistry fixed (see §6)
```

---

### Minor Quality Items

```
Vectrix             SpotBugs not configured      (unlike Core and Event)
DynamisSky          KelvinToRgb TODO             DONE — upstreamed to Vectrix ColorSciencef
DynamisCore         lifecycle exceptions          DONE — moved to WorldEngine api.lifecycle
fastnoiselitenouveau non-standard src dir         uses src/main/Java (capitalized)
```

---

# 10. Next Architecture Programs

Recommended next efforts.

### Program 1 — Package Standardization Completion (**DONE**)

All subsystems have been migrated to the `org.dynamisengine.*` package convention as of 2026-03-15. The monorepo directory structure now reflects the logical seven-layer DAG with physical `Layer1-Foundation/` through `Layer7-Orchestration/` directories. A top-level aggregator POM (`Dynamis/pom.xml`) and per-layer aggregator POMs enable full-system builds via `mvn install` from the root.

---

### Program 2 — DynamisAI Execution Path Correction (**VERIFIED — No correction needed**)

Fresh audit (2026-03-15) confirmed that `commitTick()` is an internal agent state snapshot — not canonical mutation. All world changes flow through Intent → Oracle → CanonLog. AI's decision-making, planning, perception, and rule-manipulation authority are correctly scoped. Minor movement integration cleanup may be beneficial but is not an architectural violation.

---

### Program 3 — DynamisScripting Boundary Verification (**VERIFIED — Correct**)

Fresh audit (2026-03-15) confirmed the causality chain is correctly implemented:
- Oracle is sole canonical mutation authority
- Chronicler proposes via WorldEventEmitter, never commits directly
- RuntimeTick orchestrates correctly: time advance → Chronicler.tick() → Oracle.commit()
- No independent simulation loop detected

No correction required.

---

### Program 4 — DynamisLightEngine Large-File Decomposition (**DONE — Phase 1 + Phase 2**)

**Phase 1** — `OpenGlContext.java` decomposed from 3,553 → 1,618 lines (2026-03-15):

```
GlShaderSources.java          868 lines  (GLSL source strings)
OpenGlShadowRenderer.java     643 lines  (directional, point, local atlas shadow maps)
OpenGlPostProcessor.java      450 lines  (post-process pipeline + FBO management)
OpenGlTextureLoader.java      244 lines  (STB, KTX, BufferedImage loading)
OpenGlTemporalAA.java         226 lines  (TAA jitter, motion vectors, telemetry)
GlMathUtil.java                152 lines  (matrix math utilities)
```

All 48 engine-impl-opengl tests pass after Phase 1 decomposition.

**Phase 2** — OpenGlEngineRuntime + VulkanMainPipelineBuilder decomposed (2026-03-16):

```
OpenGlEngineRuntime.java       2,370 → 1,120 lines (53% reduction), 4 extracted classes
VulkanMainPipelineBuilder.java 1,467 → 453 lines  (69% reduction), 3 extracted classes
```

All large-file decomposition targets are now complete.

---

### Program 5 — Test Coverage Expansion (**DONE for VFX, Sky, Terrain, Audio, UI, WorldEngine**)

Completed (2026-03-15):

```
DynamisVFX        9 → 123 tests   serializer, validator, builders, LodPolicy, noise, budget,
                                   packing, physics readback, spawn scheduler, parity harness
DynamisSky       15 → 128 tests   SolarPositionCalculator, HosekWilkie/Preetham models,
                                   SkyColorConversions, SkyLutCache, TimeOfDayScheduler
DynamisTerrain   19 → 168 tests   Frustum, Matrix4f, HeightmapOps, ProceduralHeightmap,
                                   RoadMeshGenerator, ScatterRuleEngine, TerrainMaterialAtlas
```

Expanded (2026-03-16):

```
DynamisAudio       → 462 tests   GainNode, CompressorNode, EqNode, FingerprintDrivenReverbNode,
                                  EmitterParams, ReverbWetGainCalculator, FingerprintBlender, LinearResampler
DynamisUI          → 98 tests    FlowLayout, StackLayout, Label, PerformanceOverlay,
                                  event routing edge cases, Bounds extensions
DynamisWorldEngine → 45 tests    DefaultWorldTickRunner, DefaultWorldProjector,
                                  DefaultWorldBootstrapper, CodecRoundtrip
```

**Remaining targets:**

```
OpenGlEngineRuntime   decomposed (2,370 → 1,120 lines) — now testable
```

### Program 6 — JPMS Migration (**DONE — Engine-Wide**)

JPMS migration is now complete across all engine layers (2026-03-16). DynamisLightEngine was migrated first (8 module descriptors), followed by progressive rollout through all remaining layers:

```
Layer 4: DynamisLightEngine (8 modules), DynamisSky, DynamisTerrain, DynamisVFX, DynamisAudio
Layer 5: DynamisScripting, DynamisAI, DynamisPhysics, DynamisExpression (mvel-main, mvel-benchmarks)
Layer 6: DynamisUI (including demos), DynamisInput, DynamisWindow, DynamisLocalization
Layer 7: DynamisWorldEngine
```

Combined with prior Layer 2 (DynamisGPU, MeshForge) and Layer 3 (DynamisECS, DynamisSceneGraph, DynamisSession) work, every engine subsystem now has explicit module-info.java. Reflection bridges (Sky, upscalers) have been migrated to ServiceLoader (2026-03-16).

Note: DynamisExpression mvel-main has 156 pre-existing test failures unrelated to JPMS.

### Program 7 — Reference Application

Create a **reference game / demo application** (e.g., Doom-like).

Purpose:

```
demonstrate real engine composition
host cross-subsystem bootstrap examples
replace subsystem-local demo code
```

# 11. Overall Assessment

The Dynamis architecture is **mature and coherent**.

Key strengths:

* clear subsystem separation with zero layer violations in production code
* well-defined execution authorities verified by fresh audit
* successful seam-tightening programs (Physics/Collision, Graphics cluster)
* causality chain (AI → Canon → Graph) correctly implemented and verified
* FundamentalTypeContractTests across ECS, Session, Content prevent duplicate type definitions
* completed package standardization with uniform `org.dynamisengine.*` naming
* top-level and per-layer aggregator POMs enabling full-system builds
* physical directory layout mirrors logical seven-layer DAG

The 2026-03-15 audit verified that DynamisAI and DynamisScripting — previously flagged for architectural correction — are architecturally sound. The `commitTick` concern in AI was clarified as internal agent state snapshotting, and Scripting's Oracle/Chronicler causality chain is correctly separated.

Remaining work is **code quality**, not architecture:
* ~~Large-file decomposition Phase 2~~ — **COMPLETE**: OpenGlEngineRuntime (2,370 → 1,120, 53% reduction), VulkanMainPipelineBuilder (1,467 → 453, 69% reduction)
* ~~JPMS adoption~~ — **COMPLETE engine-wide** (all layers 1-7 have module-info.java)
* ~~Reflection bridges → ServiceLoader migration~~ — **COMPLETE** (ExternalUpscalerBridge, VendorUpscalerSdkProvider, VulkanSkyRuntimeBridge)
* Incomplete implementations (DynamisAudio native device)
* Reference application to host cross-subsystem integration examples

Completed since last report (2026-03-16):
* DynamisExpression thread safety: ClassManager (volatile + unmodifiable), LambdaRegistry (ConcurrentHashMap + AtomicInteger + volatile), MVEL.get() safe via upstream fixes
* OpenGlContext decomposed: 3,553 → 1,618 lines (6 extracted classes)
* Large-file Phase 2: OpenGlEngineRuntime 2,370 → 1,120 lines (4 extracted classes), VulkanMainPipelineBuilder 1,467 → 453 lines (3 extracted classes)
* Test coverage expanded: VFX (9→123), Sky (15→128), Terrain (19→168), Audio (→462), UI (→98), WorldEngine (→45)
* JPMS migration: complete across all engine layers (1-7), every subsystem has module-info.java
* Package standardization and monorepo reorganization verified via full-system build
* Hygiene: KelvinToRgb upstreamed from DynamisSky to Vectrix ColorSciencef
* Hygiene: DynamisTerrain physics/meshforge module requires uncommented with correct module names
* Hygiene: DynamisCore lifecycle exceptions moved to WorldEngine api.lifecycle
* ServiceLoader migration: ExternalUpscalerBridge, VendorUpscalerSdkProvider, VulkanSkyRuntimeBridge — all reflection-based bridges eliminated
